# DSA Music Playlist Project

- **Display Current Song:** Shows the currently playing song.
- **Play Next Song:** Moves to the next song in the playlist.
- **Play Previous Song:** Moves to the previous song in the playlist.
- **Memory Management:** The program ensures that allocated memory is freed before exiting.
